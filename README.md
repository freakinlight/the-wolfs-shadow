# The Wolf's Shadow

## Project Overview
"The Wolf's Shadow" is a captivating browser-based game that leverages the timeless tale of Little Red Riding Hood. Players guide Little Red through increasingly perilous woods, dodging the ever-approaching Big Bad Wolf. Developed using HTML Canvas and JavaScript, the game combines engaging gameplay mechanics with beautifully rendered visuals and dynamic interactions.

## Technologies
- **JavaScript**: Powers the core gameplay logic, event handling, and dynamic content updates.
- **HTML Canvas**: Used for drawing and animating game elements on the web page dynamically.
- **CSS**: Manages the presentation layer, including game layout and element styling.
- **Affinity Designer**: Creates high-quality, scalable vector graphics for game characters and environments.

## Installation
To set up the game on your local machine, follow these instructions:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/freakinlight/The-wolfs-shadow.git
cd The-wolfs-shadow
# Simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser to start the game
```

## Features
### Gameplay
- **Dynamic Parallax Scrolling**: Creates a multi-layered visual effect that enhances the depth and immersion of the game environment.
- **Adaptive Difficulty Levels**: As the game progresses, the distance between Little Red and the Wolf decreases, adding to the game's challenge.

### Interactivity
- **Collision Detection**: Implements a sophisticated mechanism to detect overlaps between game entities such as characters and objects.
- **Pickup and Power-ups**: Collect apples to temporarily boost Little Red's speed, delaying the wolf's advance.

### Audiovisual Elements
- **Custom Artwork and Animations**: Each sprite and background is carefully crafted to reflect the fairytale theme.
- **Soundtrack and Effects**: Features an original musical score and sound effects that players can toggle on/off.

### Game Mechanics
```javascript
// Example of collision detection logic
isTouching(object) {
  return !(this.xPos > object.xPos + object.dx || 
           this.xPos + 50 < object.xPos ||
           this.yPos > object.yPos + object.dy || 
           this.yPos + 50 < object.yPos);
}
```

```javascript
// Level progression mechanic
addLevel() {
  this.level++;
  this.bigBadWolf.minXPos += 50; // Increases the challenge by moving the wolf closer
  this.foreGround.text = new ScreenText(this.context, this.level);
}
```

## Future Enhancements
- **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure the game is fully responsive and playable on various touchscreen devices.
- **Dynamic Endings**: Different ending animations based on player success or failure.
- **Gameplay Variability**: Introduce varied apple effects, each with unique gameplay impacts.
